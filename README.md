# Event source

Event Source is a web-based application that allows users to create, manage, and track events. It is designed to simplify the process of organizing and coordinating events.

## Features

1. **Create events**: Users can create new events by providing event details such as title, date, time, location, and description. They can also specify if the event requires RSVP, if it is a virtual event or if transportation is provided

2. **Manage events**: Users can view and manage their created events. They can edit event details (not implemented yet), see guests preferences such as dietary needs, add or remove guests, and track RSVP responses.

3. **Invitation management**: Users can send invitations to guests via email and directly to google calendars (not implemented yet). The application provides a guest list feature where users can see who has been invited, who has accepted, and who has declined the invitation.

4. **Transportation management**: For events that require transportation, users can add transportation details such as mode of transportation, cost, pickup location, and available seats. Guests can indicate whether they need transportation and can join or leave the designated transportation.

5. **User preferences**: Users can specify their dietary restrictions and accessibility needs in their user profile. This information is used to accommodate guests' preferences when planning and organizing events.
